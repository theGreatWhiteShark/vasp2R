Description: The basic function of this package is to parse the CHGCAR file
    of a VASP calculation and provide a list of three data.frames to the user:
    one contains the cartesian coordinates of the atoms in the cell with their
    individual atom type as a factor, another contains the coordinates and the
    corresponding charge at each position of the calculated grid and the last
    constains the lattice vectors of the cell. In addition some functions to ease
    the manipulation of the data for plotting e.g. rotating an object or extracting
    a specific plane in a volume) are provided.
